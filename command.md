# Difference Between grep and awk Commands
When working with Linux, two powerful commands for text processing often come upâ€”grep and awk. While they may seem similar, they serve distinct purposes. Letâ€™s dive into the details!

# grep Command
#Purpose:
grep is a tool for searching and filtering text based on patterns.

#Key Feature:
Quick and efficient for finding lines that match a specific regular expression.

#Example:
Find all lines containing the word "error" in a log file:

#grep "ERROR" logfile.txt  

#Output:
2024-12-06 10:45:23 ERROR: Unable to connect to server  
2024-12-06 10:50:12 ERROR: Database timeout  

# awk Command
#Purpose:
awk is a text processing tool and programming language for extracting, transforming, and analyzing data.

#Key Feature:
Works with fields/columns, making it ideal for complex operations.

#Example:
Extract the first and third columns from a CSV file:

awk -F',' '{print $1, $3}' data.csv

#Input (data.csv):
ID,Name,Salary  
101,John,5000  
102,Jane,6000  
#Output:
ID Salary  
101 5000  
102 6000

# When to Use?
Use grep for simple pattern searches.
Use awk for advanced text processing or when working with structured data like CSVs.

# Pro Tip: Combine Them!
Combine grep and awk for even more power.

#Example:
Extract the timestamp of error messages from a log file:

grep "error" logfile.txt | awk '{print $1, $2}'
