# Linux File System

The Linux file system is a hierarchical directory structure used to store and organize data on Linux operating systems. It adheres to standards like the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), ensuring consistency across different Linux distributions.

---

## Structure of the Linux File System
The Linux file system is organized as a tree starting from the root directory (`/`). All files and directories stem from this root.

### **Root Directory (`/`):**
- The topmost directory in the hierarchy.
- Contains essential system files and directories required for the system to boot and run.

---

## Key Directories in the File System

### **`/bin` (Binary)**
- Contains essential user command binaries (executables) needed during boot and single-user mode.
- Examples: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`.

### **`/boot`**
- Contains files needed to boot the system, like the bootloader, kernel, and initramfs.
- Examples: `vmlinuz` (kernel), `grub` (bootloader).

### **`/dev` (Devices)**
- Contains special device files that represent hardware devices.
- Examples: `sda` (disk), `tty` (terminal devices).

### **`/etc` (Configuration Files)**
- Contains system-wide configuration files and scripts.
- Examples: `passwd` (user account info), `hosts` (hostname resolution).

### **`/home`**
- Contains personal directories for each user.
- Example: `/home/username`.

### **`/lib` and `/lib64`**
- Contains essential shared libraries required by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
- Examples: `libc.so` (C standard library).

### **`/media`**
- Temporary mount point for removable media like USB drives or DVDs.
- Examples: `/media/usb`, `/media/cdrom`.

### **`/mnt`**
- Generic mount point for temporarily mounting filesystems.
- Used by administrators for manual mounting.

### **`/opt`**
- Contains optional or third-party software.
- Often used for manually installed applications.

### **`/proc`**
- Virtual filesystem providing information about system processes and kernel parameters.
- Examples: `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`.

### **`/root`**
- The home directory for the root (administrator) user.
- Separate from `/home`.

### **`/run`**
- Contains runtime data for processes and system services.
- Examples: PID files, sockets.

### **`/sbin` (System Binaries)**
- Contains essential binaries for system administration.
- Examples: `fsck`, `reboot`.

### **`/srv`**
- Contains data for specific services like web servers or FTP servers.
- Example: `/srv/http`.

### **`/sys`**
- Virtual filesystem for interaction with kernel devices and drivers.
- Provides information and control for devices.

### **`/tmp`**
- Temporary files created by users or processes.
- Automatically cleaned up on reboot.

### **`/usr`**
- Secondary hierarchy for user applications and utilities.
- Subdirectories:
  - `/usr/bin`: Non-essential user command binaries.
  - `/usr/lib`: Libraries for `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`.
  - `/usr/share`: Architecture-independent data (e.g., icons, documentation).

### **`/var`**
- Contains variable files like logs, cache, and spool files.
- Examples:
  - `/var/log`: System logs.
  - `/var/cache`: Application caches.
  - `/var/spool`: Data waiting for processing (e.g., print jobs).

## File Types in Linux
1. **Regular Files (`-`)**: Contain data or code.
2. **Directories (`d`)**: Containers for files and other directories.
3. **Symbolic Links (`l`)**: Pointers to other files.
4. **Character Devices (`c`)**: Devices like terminals.
5. **Block Devices (`b`)**: Devices like hard drives.
6. **Sockets (`s`)**: Inter-process communication endpoints.
7. **Pipes (`p`)**: Enable communication between processes.

## Features of Linux File System

### **1. Journaling**
- Filesystems like `ext4`, `XFS`, and `btrfs` use journaling to maintain data integrity by recording changes before applying them.

### **2. Permissions**
- File permissions are defined for the owner, group, and others:
  - Read (`r`), Write (`w`), Execute (`x`).

### **3. Mounting**
- Filesystems are mounted at specific points in the directory tree.
- Example:
  ```bash
  mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
  ```

### **4. Links**
- **Hard Links**: Point directly to the data on disk.
- **Soft Links (Symbolic)**: Reference another file by path.

### **5. Inodes**
- Each file is associated with an inode containing metadata like size, owner, and permissions.

### **6. Virtual File Systems**
- `/proc` and `/sys` provide runtime system information without consuming disk space.

## Popular Linux File Systems
1. **Ext4**:
   - Default for many Linux distributions.
   - Reliable and efficient.
2. **XFS**:
   - High-performance journaling filesystem.
3. **Btrfs**:
   - Advanced features like snapshots, compression, and RAID.
4. **FAT32/NTFS**:
   - Used for compatibility with Windows.
