# Disk Monitoring in Linux

Monitoring disk usage in Linux is essential for maintaining the health and performance of a system. It helps identify storage bottlenecks, manage capacity, and avoid system crashes due to full disks.

## Why Monitor Disk Usage?
- **Prevent Downtime**: Ensure adequate storage for system operations.
- **Optimize Performance**: Avoid slowdowns caused by disk I/O issues.
- **Plan Capacity**: Forecast storage requirements effectively.
- **Ensure Data Integrity**: Detect potential hardware issues early.

## Common Disk Monitoring Tools

### 1. **df (Disk Free)**
- Displays the amount of available and used disk space on filesystems.
- Usage:
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```
  **Options:**
  - `-h`: Human-readable format.
  - `-T`: Show filesystem types.
  - `-i`: Display inode usage.

### 2. **du (Disk Usage)**
- Estimates file and directory space usage.
- Usage:
  ```bash
  du -sh /path/to/directory
  ```
  **Options:**
  - `-s`: Summarize total.
  - `-h`: Human-readable format.

### 3. **lsblk (List Block Devices)**
- Displays information about block devices.
- Usage:
  ```bash
  lsblk
  ```
  **Options:**
  - `-f`: Show filesystem information.
  - `-o NAME,SIZE,TYPE`: Customize output columns.

### 4. **fdisk**
- Partition management tool that also provides disk information.
- Usage:
  ```bash
  sudo fdisk -l
  ```

### 5. **iostat (Input/Output Statistics)**
- Provides CPU and I/O usage statistics for devices and partitions.
- Usage:
  ```bash
  iostat -dx
  ```



## Best Practices for Disk Monitoring
1. **Set Threshold Alerts**: Automate alerts for disk usage thresholds.
2. **Monitor Regularly**: Schedule periodic checks using cron jobs.
3. **Log and Analyze**: Keep historical data for trend analysis.
4. **Use RAID**: Enhance disk redundancy and reliability.
5. **Automate Cleanup**: Clear temporary or unnecessary files regularly.
